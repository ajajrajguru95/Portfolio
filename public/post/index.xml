      <description>&lt;p&gt;When i decided to start with my own portfolio/blog i started looking at other bloggers/developers blog as to how to start it without including much of the non-needed stuff and also hassle free. I had an idea related to static site generators in past as i had worked on it for couple of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
