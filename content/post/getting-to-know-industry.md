Students who have just passed out from college are having tough time understanding how a company/industry function on a day to day basis, how are the processes carried out in an IT or any other general product or service based company. That's when session like **Getting to know the industry** try to guide those lost soul's into the fundamentals of industry standards.

I was lucky enough to have this opportunity to conduct similar session for computer science students in SPK(same college where i completed my higher education).

Below is the presentation that was presented to the students while explaining them the importance of each topic and points while giving real world examples.

The experience was fantastic and the response was overwhelming at the same time. :heart_eyes: 

Students now a days are exposed to Internet at a quite young age and they are also really talented when it comes to anything related to tech so it becomes easy to explain and make them aware of the technology that company adopts.

Overall it's a really good experience not only as a mentor but also as a student as a learner. The time, research and the thinking that goes into gathering information on such ignored but yet meaningful topic sometimes helps you to understand the minute details behind the stuff that you already know.

Also it's a good practice to work on your public speaking and presentation skills as most people think that **Public speaking is terrifying** for those I'll say give it a try it looks devastating at first but at the end down the line you are the one who are learning. :v:
