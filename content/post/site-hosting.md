When i decided to start with my own portfolio/blog i started looking at other bloggers/developers blog as to how to do it without including much of the non-needed stuff and hassle free. I had an idea related to static site generators in past as i had worked on it for couple of projects.

I'm a huge fan of [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and also was aware of what this static site generator can do so was curious as to what extend can i take HUGO with same functionality and feel as of CMS's provide and turns out it's unbeatable. 

Those who don't know what HUGO is here a nice [read](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/hugo101-getting-started-with-hugo-and-deploying-to-netlify-9a813fe23b94) which also covers it's installation.

The reason i love HUGO over tons of other static site generators is that its fast like blazing fast and the reason is it's built in GO.

This site is build entirely through HUGO and hosted through awesome [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) :metal:. I love netlify for many reasons one of them that it's free and provide enough functionality/options for you to get started in their free plan. Other than that they offer continuous deployment with github so every time you push you repository to your tracking branch on github your website is rebuild and deployed within couple of seconds.

Talking about content management feature than netlify has that too sorted out for us in their cool [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

If you're someone who's into [serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/tags/serverless/) which is the latest hype you're in luck with Netlify.

You can also take advantage of netlify forms and large media through which you can set an optimization for your heavy images and also take contact form/newsletter entries without writing single line of backend code. :kissing_closed_eyes:
